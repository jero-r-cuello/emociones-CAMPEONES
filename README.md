# Emociones-CAMPEONES

This repository contains scripts (specifically developed for my undergraduate thesis) used in the project **"Affective experiences in immersive environments: continuous self-report and multimodal physiological recording"**, developed in the Laboratory of Consciousness, Culture and Complexity (CoCuCo) of the University of Buenos Aires. The main objective is to generate a public database that documents real-time emotional self-reports along with central and peripheral physiological measures obtained in immersive environments.
